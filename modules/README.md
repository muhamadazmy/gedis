Modules are go modules that is available for LUA packages.

This directory contains the built in modules provided by gedis itself. (Still very few)
So many modules are already provided from [GopherLua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua#id13)

## TODO:
- Plugin modules, so other people can easily build modules for Gedis
